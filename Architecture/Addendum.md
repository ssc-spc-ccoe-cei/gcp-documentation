### DNS

#### [DNS Overview](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/dns-overview)

High level overview of some of the Google Cloud resource types to accelerate the design and deployment of your *workload*.  

#### General DNS knowledge

- DNS server types *(Authoritative, Recursive)*
- Zones *(Public, Private, Delegated, Split brain/horizon)*
- Records *(A, AAAA, Cname, Mx, NS, PTR, SOA)*

#### GCP DNS Key Terms

[Key Terms](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/key-terms)

#### Google Cloud Specific Documentation

[Cloud DNS Overview](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/overview/)

[Cloud Domains Overview](https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/overview)  

#### DNS Zones

#### Internal DNS

Internal DNS names are names that Google Cloud creates automatically. Available in a single VPC by default, resolved by the metadata server (169.254.169.254). Google Cloud automatically creates, updates, and removes these DNS records. Please see [Internal DNS zone documentation](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/internal-dns).

#### Private Zones
 
Managed custom domain names for virtual machines and other GCP resources without exposing the DNS data to the public internet. Please see [Private Zone Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones#create-private-zone).

Unless you have specified an alternative name server in an outbound server policy, Google Cloud first attempts to find a record in a private zone (or forwarding zone or peering zone) authorized for your VPC network before it looks for the record in a public zone.

##### Options

* [Forward Queries to another server](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/forwarding-zones)
* [DNS Peering](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/peering-zones)
* [Managed Reverse Lookup Zone](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/managed-reverse-lookup-zones)

#### Public, External DNS Zone

Create DNS records in public zones to publish your service on the internet. Please see [Public Zone Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/dns-overview#public_zone). 

##### Anycast Resolution
>> Google DNS has some fame associated to it for it's resiliency and global availability properties, with publicly available resolvers such as:  
>>>  8.8.8.8  
>>>  8.8.8.4

These resolvers are *anycast addresses* with requests being routed to the nearest location advertising the address.

#### Cross Project Binding

Cross project binding is used to manage private DNS zones that service another project in the same organization.

[Cross project binding Overview](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/zones-overview#cross-project_binding)  
[Creating a Zone with cross project binding](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/cross-project-binding)

### Cloud Armor

#### [Cloud Armor Overview ](https://cloud.google.com/armor/docs/cloud-armor-overview)

Google Cloud Armor is a DDoS and application defense service the helps protect your *service*. Cloud Armor is tightly coupled with the Global HTTPS(S) Cloud Load Balancer. Cloud Armor protects your network services, typically behind a load balancer from DOS and other web based attacks. Enforcement is managed at the edge Point of Presence (POP), as close to the source traffic as possible. Traffic can be filtered and defended against at layer 7 of the OSI model. 

##### Cloud Armour Encompasses:

* Policies/Rules
* Allowlist / Denylist IP's

##### Cloud Armor Policies & Ordering:

- Rules (allow) [Priority 1]
- Rules (Deny) [Priority 2]

##### How it works:

* Create a policy with +1 rules
    * Supply IP range(s) to apply rule to
    * On rule/IP match: Allow/Deny traffic
      * Overlap rules with different priorities
    * Apply policy to Targets
      * Target = Load balanced backend services  

##### Example Policy Scopes:  

* Create multiple rules, overlapping to create finer grained rules.  
* SQL Injection Prevention (CSS), Geo based access control.  
* Allows edge traffic blocking.

### VPC Service Controls  

#### [VPC Service Controls Overview](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview)

#### *Important* [Terminology](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview#terminology) 

A service perimeter creates a security boundary around Google Cloud resources. You can configure a perimeter to control communications from virtual machines (VMs) to a Google Cloud service (API), and between Google Cloud services. A perimeter allows free communication within the perimeter but, by default, blocks communication to Google Cloud services across the perimeter. The perimeter does not block access to any third-party API or services in the internet. [Reference doc.](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview#isolate)  

#### Quick Start

[Learn](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/set-up-service-perimeter) how to set up a service perimeter using VPC Service Controls in the Google Cloud console.

#### General information
VPC service controls allow blocking or restriction of api services at the Project or VPC network level 

- Protects against data exfiltration  
- Create a perimeter  
  - Apply to a Project
  - Add services to restrict such as the storage API

#### [Access Context Levels](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/use-access-levels)

### Config Sync

#### [Config Sync Overview](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/config-sync-overview)  

Config Sync is a GitOps service offered as a part of Anthos. Config Sync is built on an open source core and lets cluster operators and platform administrators deploy configurations from a source of truth. The service has the flexibility to support one or many clusters and any number of repositories per cluster or namespace. The clusters can be in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment.  

Config Sync continuously reconciles the state of Config Controller with files stored in one or more Git repositories. This GitOps strategy lets you manage and deploy common configurations with a process that is auditable, transactional, reviewable, and version-controlled.

#### Tools and Utilities

[Kubectl](https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/how-to/configure-config-sync-kubectl)  

### kpt

[KPT Readme.md](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kpt/#readme) is an open source project used to hydrate yaml, get packages, apply functions, search and replace in yaml manifests. kpt is a package centric toolchain that enables a WYSIWYG configuration authoring and authoring enabling tool.
