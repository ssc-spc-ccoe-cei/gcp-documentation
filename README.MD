Shared Services Canada has built an enterprise virtual datacenter in Google Cloud to host workloads from any of the 43 departments of Government of Canada. These workloads are integrated into what we call a **Landing Zone**.

This repo will demonstrate how SSC implemented the Landing zone v2 solution available [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit/tree/main/docs/landing-zone-v2) in order to achieve **Day 0, 1 and 2** operations.
