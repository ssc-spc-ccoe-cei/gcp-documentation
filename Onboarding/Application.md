# Application Onboarding

## Required Information

### Common

1. Naming convention for project-id : `<client-code><environment-code><region-code><data-classification>`-`<project-owner>`-`<user defined string>`

    *Notice the 2 "-" before and after `<project-owner>`
    - client-code (2 characters)
    - environment-code (1 character)
    - region-code (1 character) : "m" projects are always a global/multi-region resource
    - data-classification (1 character): "u" or "a" or "b"
    - project-owner: string (**total project-id string length cannot exceed 30 characters**)
    - user defined string: string (**total project-id string length cannot exceed 30 characters**):

1. Billing Account ID to be associated with this project

### Experimentation

1. user, group or serviceAccount with editor role at project level

    **user or group has to exist in a Google Cloud Identity (any existing domain)**

### DEV, PREPROD, PROD (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

1. Host Project ID (with a Shared VPC) that exist to connect this workload/service project

## Pre-requisite

1. Ensure service account `projects-sa` has been granted `Billing Account User` role on the Billing Account.
1. Locally clone the landing zone repo for this environment
1. Create a branch from main

## Add client's application to the landing zone repository

1. Move into source-base folder

    ```shell
    cd source-base
    ```

1. Get the workload package

    *Some folders may need to be created beforehand like `<data classification>`
    - Experimentation

      ```shell
      kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit.git/solutions/project/project-experimentation@main ./landing-zone/hierarchy/clients/<client name>/applications/<project-id>
      ```

    - DEV, PREPROD, PROD

      ```shell
      kpt pkg get https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/pubsec-declarative-toolkit.git/solutions/project/project-experimentation@main ./landing-zone/hierarchy/clients/<client name>/applications/<data classification>/<project-id>
      ```
