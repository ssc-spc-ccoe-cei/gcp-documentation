# Client Onboarding

## Required Information

1. Client's Name
1. When creating the name of a client folder, it must adhere to a bilingual nomenclature and leverage the official abbreviation list of current Government of Canada departments, agencies, Crown Corporations and special operating agencies: [https://www.canada.ca/en/government/dept.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/dept.html).

   For example, when creating a client folder to represent Shared Services Canada, employ both the official English and French abbreviation separated by a dash (e.g. ssc-spc).

   ![folder](img/departments-and-agencies-en-ssc.png)

   ![folder](img/departments-and-agencies-fr-spc.png)

   In order to uphold folder name requirements in the Google Cloud Console ([Creating and managing folders](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-folders#:~:text=For%20example%2C%20to%20create%20folders,%2C%20spaces%2C%20hyphens%20and%20underscores)), avoid using accented characters in French.
